Data for the live meta analysis created to examine the effects of theatre in prisons on identity and empathy

# Instructions for Use

This is a Live Meta-analysis database that aims to examine the impact of theatre in prisons on empathy and identity. 

Inclusion criteria include:
* Studies involving incarcerated individuals
* any country or geography (or language)
* Intervention: Theatre must be central component of study
* Studies reporting on at least one measurable benefit that can be used to make conclusions regarding empathy or identity.
* Empirical studies.
* Peer-reviewed journal articles, theses, or grey literature with clear methodology and results, all timeframes.

Exclusion criteria include: 
* Studies focusing solely on arts-based programming not involving theatre (e.g., visual arts, music therapy).
* Case studies or commentaries lacking empirical data.
* Studies on theatre in non-prison settings (e.g., schools, hospitals, community theatre).
* Interventions where theatre was not the core rehabilitative component (e.g., theatre as a peripheral engagement activity).
* Theoretical or academic explorations of theatre in prisons.

Full PRISMA guidelines available on request. 

This meta analysis requres three pieces of data:
* Mean of time 1 and time 2
* Sample Size
* Standard deviation of time 1 and time 2 **OR** Z Score

Columns of data must be labeled as below:

* Mean Time 1 = mean_1
* Mean Time 2 = mean_2
* Standard deviation Time 1 = sd_1
* Standard deviation Time 2 = sd_2
* Z Score = z_score
* Sample Size = sample_size
* Measure of empathy/identty = measure

Order and capitalisation of the columns does not matter, but labelling does.
